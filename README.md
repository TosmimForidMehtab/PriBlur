## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **PriBlur**!

This browser extension gives you the power to hide sensitive information on any webpage with a single click. Whether you're in a business presentation, a live demo, or an online class, you can confidently share your screen knowing that your private data, personal messages, or confidential work details are safely blurred out.

Our goal is to provide a tool that is both easy to use and completely secure, running entirely on your computer without ever touching your data.

## ✨ Key Features

-   🎨 **Multiple Blur Shapes:** Choose between Rectangle, Circle, or a freeform Custom Shape tool.
-   🖱️ **Interactive Editing:** All blur regions are draggable and can be removed instantly with the Eraser tool.
-   📄 **Sticks to Content:** Blurs scroll with the page, ensuring they always cover the intended element.
-   💾 **Save Your Layouts:** Create "Profiles" to instantly load specific blur setups for different tasks (e.g., "Work Meeting," "Personal Project").
-   👁️ **Toggle Mode:** Temporarily disable all blurs with a hotkey (**`Alt+P`**) to quickly see the content underneath.
-   🔒 **100% Private:** The extension is fully self-contained. Your data, Browse activity, or blur patterns are never collected or transmitted anywhere.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> **Q: Will this work with Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams?**
>
> **A:** Yes! It works on any website you are sharing via your Chrome browser tab. The blur is applied directly to the webpage, so anyone viewing your screen share will see the blurred areas.

> **Q: Do the blurs stay in one place or move when I scroll?**
>
> **A:** The blurs are designed to "stick" to the content on the page. If you blur a paragraph at the top of a long article, that blur will scroll up with the paragraph, which is the intended behavior.

> **Q: Is this extension secure? Is my data safe?**
>
> **A:** Your security is our top priority. The extension is 100% client-side, meaning all operations happen directly on your computer. We do not—and cannot—collect, store, or transmit any of your data, Browse history, or personal information.
